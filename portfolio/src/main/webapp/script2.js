I don't have many pictures on my laptop but feel free to take a look at my instagram as I like taking pictures of flowers and the places I have been. I usually like to take macro pictures of small things like bugs and flowers. I also love to spend time with my family when I am home since I go to school halfway across the country (around a 40 hour car ride to be exact). I also love to snowboard and do a lot of teaching in my spare time. I go out to the mountains often and volunteer with a group called the Canadian Adaptive Snowsports (CADS). This lets me help teach other people who have disabilities how to snowboard. I have been working with someone for the past three years and we finally got him on and off the chair lift successfully this year! I also coach someone who is visually impared and is striving to go to the paralympics!";
